🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project on Analyzing Pizza Sales Using Power BI! 🚀

I recently completed an interactive pizza sales report, and I’m thrilled to highlight some key features and insights:

📊 Daily and Monthly Trends: Visualize total pizza orders and sales figures on a daily and monthly basis. Gain insights into peak sales periods to enhance business strategies.

🍕 Pizza Category Analysis: Delve into sales by pizza category to understand customer preferences and identify the most popular categories, helping to tailor the menu offerings.

📏 Pizza Size Analysis: Examine the distribution of pizza sales by size, enabling better inventory management and menu customization based on customer choices.

🏆 Top-Selling Pizzas: Discover the top-selling pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and total orders. Use this information to optimize the menu and increase profits.

📉 Least-Selling Pizzas: Identify the least-selling pizzas to make informed decisions on which items might need re-evaluation or promotion.

🔹Data Transformation with Power Query:
Extracted and transformed raw data from multiple sources.
Cleaned and formatted the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Created custom columns and calculated fields to enhance the dataset.
Merged and appended data tables to build a comprehensive dataset.
Applied data normalization techniques to improve data quality.

🔹Creating Dashboards with Power BI:
Used Power BI to create user-friendly and interactive dashboards for visualizing pizza sales data.

🔹Dashboard Overview:
